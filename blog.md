## Assignment 2

I refer to the article ["Why are the Digital Humanities so White?"](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/29) by Tara McPherson who discusses a parallel between hard sciences, in the UNIX operating system, and digital humanities, media and race, looking through a lenticular lens. This lens type can show one image, or the other, but not both images at the same time or a merged version, e.g., a postcard of two 3-D images. 

Both the computer and the lenticular lens mediate images and objects, changing their relationship but frequently suppressing that process of relation, much like the divided departments of the contemporary university. The fragmentary knowledges encouraged by many forms and experiences of the digital neatly parallel the logics that underwrite the covert racism endemic to our times, operating in potential feedback loops, supporting each other. If scholars of race have highlighted how certain tendencies within poststructuralist theory simultaneously respond to and marginalize race, this maneuver is at least partially possible because of a parallel and increasing dispersion of electronic forms across culture, forms that simultaneously enact and shape their new modes of thinking (13).

### Article Analysis, A Parallel Structure of UNIX and Race

Unix and race are separate entities which McPherson looks at through a lenticular lens. She uses a parallel structure to explain why the digital humanities are so white. 

#### Pre UNIX

Assembly language, Von Neumann machine/processor, do-it-yourself data structures carved out, with SAL, MAL, and TAL (True Assembly Language). One could argue that programming in assembly was complicated in that it required keeping track of the space used, being careful not to overwrite areas by keeping the data structures in the program 'segregated' manually in the program. One could also argue that it was simple, transparent.

#### UNIX and Mid nineteen sixties

The operating system Unix overtook Von Neumann's machine programmed with asssembly language. UNIX had shells and used modularity, making it less open and accessible than previous opreating systems programmed with assembly language. 

  **Unix**   |        **Race**
  ------ | -----------------------------
  modular |  overt racism
  shell   |  segregation

#### Late 1990s


**Unix, Java** |       **Race**
------------ | --------------------------------
modular |  covert racism
OOP |  feedback loops further racism


Structures responding to and marginalizing race - feminism, there is no one woman's story, but many stories, the one/the other. 
The other always in relation to the one, but never 'the one.'



### Text Analysis

As Thomas Rommel writes, The history of literary computing, however, shows that only a limited number of textual phenomena can be analyzed profitably in the context of quantitative and qualitative computer-based analyses of style. These phenomena have to be linked to some surface features that can be identified by electronic means, usually by some form of pattern matching. Computers are exceptionally well suited for this kind of analysis, and only human intuition and insight, in combination with the raw computing power of machines programmed to act as highly specialized electronic tools, can make some texts or textual problems accessible to scholars.

An example:
This text analysis visualization, presents evidence that supports my core argument. 
The text analysis tool I used was [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org). Here is the text analysis document window after I pasted in the text from the article, 
![](images/Voyant-tools-corpus.jpg). The results of the text analysis: This corpus has 1 document with 10,231 total words and 2,581 unique word forms. Created now.
Most frequent words in the corpus: unix (74); digital (62); race (52); modularity (40); new (37).
A closer look at the text as image. The size of the text is in direct proportion to the number of times the word is found in the corpus.
