## About me

- I am a third-year student in Interactive Arts and Science at Brock University in Digital Humanities in the Centre for Digital Humanities at Brock University. I am studying solving problems through Interactive Arts and Science. My studies include Computer Science (2003), Honours Sociology with a concentration in Social Justice and Equity (2010), Honours Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies (2015). These disciplines have provided tools and lenses for analysis from hard science and soft science perspectives as well as feminist perspectives.

- I worked in UNIX when I was the help desk for a free net. The Internet was non-graphical at the time and I worked using the command line to add users to the system, make help files to instruct business and residential clients how to connect to the system with various computers, modems, and software, and how to use/surf non-graphical Internet programs such as Archie, Veronica, and Lynx. I prorammed at the Windows command line (DOS) since 1988 and in Java since 1997 at school and on my G5 Powerbook, Macbooks, and Windows OS. I also use my two Linux OS computers.
