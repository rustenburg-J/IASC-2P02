##  About me

I am a third-year student in Digital Humanities in the Centre for Digital Humanities at Brock University. 
I am studying solving problems through Interactive Arts and Science.
My studies include Computer Science (2003), Honours Sociology with a concentration in Social Justice and Equity (2010),  Honours Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies (2015). These disciplines have provided tools and lenses for analysis from hard science and soft science perspectives as well as feminist perspectives.
